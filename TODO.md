0. MAKE EVERYTHING WORK


1. Figure out how promises work instead of editing Google's code and crossing my fingers. (popup.js) See async function refreshBlockList.
2. Connect backend and frontend.
3. Make icons.

Planned for version 1.something : Fix the syntax of all this bullshit. There are so many commented out sections and random things everywhere from debugging. It's a mess.
