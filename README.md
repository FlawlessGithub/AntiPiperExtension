# AntiPiperExtension
A Chrome extension to thwart ***Removed for Privacy Reasons*** Piper, enemy of the people.

The goal of this project is to make a discreet extension that blocks certain URLs from your history. Ideally, it should be able to do so without any kind of manual input apart from a list of non-***Removed for Privacy Reasons***-approved URLs.

How will I accomplish this? Good question, as I've never made an extension for Chrome before, nor have I worked in HTML or JS in any meaningful way.

I think the way I want to do it is let the extension access some kind of text file that contains one URL per line, but this could change, depending on what an extension can and can't do, since I haven't done much research.

Time to get started!
